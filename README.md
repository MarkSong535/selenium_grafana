# Selenium ScreenShot of Grafana Dashboard

This project is to take a screenshot of Grafana dashboard using Selenium and Python.

Please configure `conf.json` with the information from your Grafana dashboard.

To fetch the `button_class`, use developer mode to find the class of the login button that is clicked on login.

To find the `dashboard_url`, go to the dashboard you want to take a screenshot of and copy the URL (remember to use kiosk mode).
